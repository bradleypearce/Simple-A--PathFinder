Pathfinding Program Guide
By Bradley Pearce 

1. Run the exe, the tilemap will load the data and output the nodes to the screen (providing the tilemap is in the release folder). 

2. Whilst the game is running, you can use your mouse to define a start position (left click). Once you have defined a start position, the node will be highlighted yellow. 

3. Once you've set a start position, you may left click on another node to define an end position. The node highlighted will be red. 

4. Once a start and end position are set, the pathfinder will calculate the best path to that destination and the pink circle will move along the path. The path 
will be coloured blue on screen.  

5. Whilst the unit is moving along the path, you can define a new end position and the unit's path will update. 

6. To reset both the start and end position and clear the path, right click. 

NOTES: 

- For the selection to work correctly, do not resize the screen. A limitation of SFML's mouse input is that it's only relative to the mouse's position in the window,
if the window is resized the mouse still goes by the previous window size.  

- Green nodes cost 30 to traverse, light blue nodes cost 5 to traverse, white notes cost 10 to traverse, black nodes are never considered for a path. 

- You cannot select unwalkable nodes.
